QualityBuilder added property to '380' things
Could not resolve reference to object with loadID Thing_Human145416 of type Verse.Pawn. Was it compressed away, destroyed, had no ID number, or not saved/loaded right? curParent=RimWorld.DirectPawnRelation curPathRelToParent=
Pawn Lenosmet has relation "Parent" with null pawn after loading. This means that we forgot to serialize pawns somewhere (e.g. pawns from passing trade ships).
